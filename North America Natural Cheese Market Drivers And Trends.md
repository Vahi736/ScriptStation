Furthermore, the growing awareness of the health benefits associated with natural cheese, such as its high protein and calcium content, contributes to market expansion. The demand for clean-label products, particularly in the dairy sector, is accelerating the consumption of natural cheeses like mozzarella, cheddar, and gouda in North America.</p><p>Trends in the North American natural cheese market are also influenced by the rising popularity of plant-based and dairy-free alternatives.
